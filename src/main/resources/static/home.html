                of lecturers on a field research that is majorly  tech based to find out the latest breakthrough and development on the
                technology aspect relating more to engineering practice, and based on their findings we move on to the next scenario
                which has to do with the traditional laboratory and industry related works.
                Based on the findings from the tech based research experiments are carried out works are executed, hypothesis are
                drawn and results obtained.
                As a result of this constant re-evaluation of our teaching process student at the Institution are always ahead of
